## Getting Started
To run this project on your system, you can download the zipped file and open it on VScode or any other IDE of your choice and run "flutter pub get" in the command line to get all the dependencies necessary to run this code and later run it on an android emulator.

The API folder contains the code that was used to host the saved Machine Learning model to Fast API such that it can be used in the app UI.
